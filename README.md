## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Done some Tidy up and changed a couple things to my code. Made both the face eyes move/change places now as well. Finally mananged to fix the dots poping out. Had to change a bit of how I wanted it to look to fit but could fix if I played around more I rekon. Overall I liked how this project has turned out, do wish I could work on a couple bits more but im happy this one didnt have as much stuff ups I had in the previous one (tho still as fun to do).
